## Geant4 Shielding Simulation 

For determining background radiation-inducing noise counts on an spacecraft-based X-ray detector.

Mission parameters:
- 500 km, near polar orbit
- loss cone angle of approximately 64 degrees during radiation belt pass-thrus
- 10^5 e-/cm^2/s flux event, which maps to 2 x 10^8 particles generated around the instrument
